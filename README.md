# Builders

Builders are tools that aid in setting properties of controls on a form. Unlike wizards, builders are reentrant, so you can reopen a builder on a particular control repeatedly. Visual FoxPro includes a number of generic builders for many of the common form controls including grids, list boxes, combo boxes, check boxes, command groups, and option groups.

* Application Builder: Displays a tabbed dialog box to simplify creating and modifying forms, complex controls, and other optional elements of effective and satisfying applications.

* AutoFormat Builder: Allows you to apply a set of styles to selected controls of the same type.

* Combo Box Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for a Combo Box control.

* Command Group Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for a Command Group control. 

* Edit Box Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for an Edit Box control.

* Form Builder: Makes it easy for you to add fields as new controls to a form. 

* Grid Builder: Makes it possible for you to set properties for a Grid control. 

* List Box Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for a List Box control.

* Option Group Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for an Option Group control. 

* Referential Integrity Builder: Helps you to ensure referential integrity by setting up triggers to control how records are inserted, updated, or deleted in related tables.

* Text Box Builder: Makes it easy for you to set properties for a Text Box control. 

* XML Web Service Builder: Makes it possible for you to bind an XML Web service to a control on a Visual FoxPro form or to an object, such as a CursorAdapter in the form's data environment, without writing code.

**Note**: although they're builders, the CursorAdapter and DataEnvironment Builders are actually found in the [Wizards](https://github.com/VFPX/Wizards) project.

Builders is part of [XSource](https://github.com/VFPX/XSource), the source files for various Visual FoxPro components. The license governing XSource can be found in the XSource_EULA.txt included with all of the XSource releases.
